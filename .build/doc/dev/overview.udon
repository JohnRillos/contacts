# Types

Types can be found in `%whom/sur/whom/hoon`

## contact

```
+$  contact
  $:  info=(map @tas info-field)
      profile=(unit profile)
  ==
```

`info`: Contact info created by the user for their contact. A map of field name (ex: `%first-name`) to value (ex: `[%text 'John']`).

`profile`: Contact info imported from another user's profile.
A contact may not have a profile if that contact doesn't have a `ship`, doesn't have %whom installed, or the profile hasn't come through via the subscription yet.

## profile

```
+$  profile
  $:  info=(map @tas [value=info-field access=access-level])
      fields=(map @tas field-def)
  ==
::
+$  access-level  ?(%public %mutual)
::
+$  field-def  [name=@t type=field-type-tag]
::
+$  field-type-tag  ?(%text %date)
```

`info`: Map of field name to value, however unlike `info.contact` each value also includes `access`.
- `%public`: this profile field is visible to anyone who adds that user as a contact.
- `%mutual`: this profile field can only be seen by users who are mutual `%pals`.

`fields`: A map of field definitions created by the other user.
This is included in profiles so we can know what display names to use for fields not known by the local user.
For example, profile could have a custom field `%anniversary` with the `field-def` `['Marriage Anniversary' %date]`.
