All of `%hark-store`'s pokes are documented below. All of them are of the
[`+$action`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#action-) type, and
all of them use a `mark` of `%hark-action`. These pokes can all be performed as
JSON through Eyre's web interface.

You may wish to refer to the [Data
Types](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types) documentation as well.

These pokes are grouped by whether they pertain to notifications, unread counts,
or both.

# Notifications

## `%add-note`

```
[%add-note =bin =body]
```

Add a notification with the specified
[+$body](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#body-) to the specified
[`+$bin`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#bin-).

---

## `%read-note`

```
[%read-note =bin]
```

Mark the `.unseen` notifications in the specified
[`+$bin`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#bin-) as read. The
notifications will be moved to the `.archive`. If there are no unseen
notifications for the specified
[`+$bin`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#bin-), the poke will
fail.

---

## `%archive`

```
[%archive =lid =bin]
```

Archive notifications with the specified
[`+$bin`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#bin-) in either `.seen`
or `.unseen`, as specified by the
[`+$lid`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#bin-).

---

## `%archive-all`

```
[%archive-all ~]
```

Archive all notifications.

---

## `%del-place`

```
[%del-place =place]
```

Underlying resource disappeared, remove all associated notifications.

All notifications for the specified
[`+$place`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#place-), whether seen,
unseen, or archived, will be completely removed.

The [`+$stats`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#stats-) for the
[`+$place`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#place-) will be
unaffected.

---

# Unread tracking

## `%unread-count`

```
[%unread-count =place inc=? count=@ud]
```

Change unread count by the specified `@ud`.

The `.count` field is the amount to change by, not an absolute new value. If
`.inc` is `%.y`, it will be increased by `.count`. If `.inc` is `%.n`, it will
be decrease by `.count`. If you try to decrease it below zero, the poke will
fail.

The value you're changing is `.count` in the
[`+$place`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#place-)'s
[`+$stats`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#stats-).

---

## `%unread-each`

```
[%unread-each =place =path]
```

Add `.path` to list of unreads for `.place`.

The given path will be added to the `.each` set in the
[`+$stats`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#stats-) for
[`+$place`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#place-).

---

## `%saw-place`

```
[%saw-place =place time=(unit time)]
```

This action updates the `.last` field in the
[`+$stats`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#stats-) of the
specified [`+$place`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#place-). The
`.last` field is the time of the last event, e.g. the most recent chat message.

If the `.time` field is null, it will be updated to `now.bowl`. Otherwise, it
will be set to the `@da` specified.

---

# Both

## `%read-count`

```
[%read-count =place]
```

Set unread count to zero for the specified
[`+$place`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#place-).

The `.count` in the
[`+$place`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#place-)'s
[`+$stats`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#stats-) will be set
back to zero, and any unarchived notifications will be moved to the `.archive`.

---

## `%read-each`

```
[%read-each =place =path]
```

Remove `.path` from unreads for `.place`.

All notifications with the specified
[`+$bin`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#bin) `path` and in the
specified [`+$place`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#place-) will
be archived. Any matching `.each` paths in the
[`+$place`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#place-)'s
[`+$stats`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#stats-) will also be
removed from the set.

---

## `%opened`

```
[%opened ~]
```

User opened notifications, reset timeboxing logic.

Unseen notifications will be moved to `.seen`. The `.timebox` in the
[`+$stats`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#stats-) of
[`+$place`](/docs/garden/dev/hark-store/types#place-)s (representing
the time of last viewing) will be reset. This occurs when a user opens the
notifications pane.
