Paths are versioned in case of future breaking changes. Versioned marks can be 
automatically converted to older marks if the older mark is provided in the path.


## Local Scry

All local `%whom` scries support `json` as well as versioned whom-specific marks.

I *strongly recommend* specifying an explicit versioned mark instead of the `noun` mark to guarantee compatibility with future versions.

- `/1/contacts` - All contacts
  - marks: `json`, `whom-contacts-2` and earlier

- `/1/contacts/mars` - Mars contacts (all contacts with ships)
  - marks: `json`, `whom-contacts-2` and earlier

- `/1/contacts/mars/~sampel-palnet` - Get a specific contact by ship
  - marks: `json`, `whom-contact-2` and earlier

- `/1/contacts/urth` - Urth contacts (all contacts without ships)
  - marks: `json`, `whom-contacts-2` and earlier

- `/1/contacts/urth/123` - Get a specific Urth contact by @t key
  - marks: `json`, `whom-contact-2` and earlier

- `/1/contacts/fuse/~sampel-palnet` - Get a contact, fallback to Groups data
  - marks: `json`, `whom-contact-2` and earlier
  - if a ship doesn't have a contact or profile in %whom, use data from Groups %contacts instead

- `/1/fields` - Field definitions
  - marks: `json`, `whom-fields-1` and earlier

- `/1/self` - Local user's profile
  - marks: `json`, `whom-self-2` and earlier

- `/0/pals` - Pals data
  - marks: `json`, `whom-pals-0`
  - This scry exposes relevant `%pals` data as json for the `%whom` UI. `%whom` does not sync any state with `%pals`.


### Deprecated

The following scries are deprecated because of a breaking change to the `json` 
representations. These scries are still functional, but they filter out any 
fields with the newer types `look`, `tint`, and `coll` for compatibility.

- `/0/contacts` - marks: `json`, `whom-contacts-1`, `whom-contacts-0`
- `/0/contacts/mars` - marks: `json`, `whom-contacts-1`, `whom-contacts-0`
- `/0/contacts/mars/~sampel-palnet` - marks: `json`, `whom-contact-1`, `whom-contact-0`
- `/0/contacts/urth` - marks: `json`, `whom-contacts-1`, `whom-contacts-0`
- `/0/contacts/urth/123` - marks: `json`, `whom-contact-1`, `whom-contact-0`
- `/0/contacts/fuse/~sampel-palnet` - marks: `json`, `whom-contact-1`, `whom-contact-0`
- `/0/fields` - marks: `json`, `whom-fields-0`
- `/0/self` - marks: `json`, `whom-self-1`, `whom-self-0`


## Remote Scry

- `/1/profile/public` - Remote user's public profile
  - mark: `whom-profile-2`

### Deprecated:
- `/0/profile/public` - Remote user's public profile
  - mark: `whom-profile-0`
  - Starting with %whom 1.12.0, profiles will no longer be published to this path.
